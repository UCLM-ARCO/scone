Release Notes for the Scone Knowledge-Base System

===========================================================================
User-visible changes since v1.0.0:
===========================================================================
Eliminated all the "simple" prefixes in the core-components files,
and updated the core.lisp file to load the new names.  Some of these
files are indeed very minimal, but I don't want to be thinking about
how complex they have to be before we drop the "simple".  If some
files ultimately have a simple "core" version and a more complex
version for some class of applications, we can worry about appropriate
naming then.

Moved some upper-ontology stuff (e.g. the definition of {event}) from
episodic.lisp to upper-lisp, since other things will need to see these
elements.

Began consolidating some of Laleh's KB stuff from the
vehicle-maintenance domain into a new directory that is not (for now)
part of "core".  Began consolidating episodic stuff from Laleh and
Maria into episodic.lisp, and began adding some of my own augmentations.
